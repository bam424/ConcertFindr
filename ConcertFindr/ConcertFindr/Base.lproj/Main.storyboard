These Terms of Use and Sale (the “Terms”) set out the legally binding terms and conditions that apply whenever you interact online with Songkick.com Limited in London, United Kingdom doing business as Songkick or any of its affiliates (collectively, “Songkick”).

These Terms are divided into four sections:

Terms of Use – which set out the terms that apply when you use the service owned and operated by Songkick and its affiliates including, without limitation, the www.songkick.com website and domain name (the “Website”), our Facebook and Spotify pages, our Android and iPhone apps (each, an “Application”) and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Songkick in connection therewith (collectively, the “Service”).
Terms of Sale – which set out the additional terms that apply when you purchase event tickets from Songkick via the www.songkick.com website and other related domains.
Songkicker Terms – which set out the additional terms that apply when you install and use our Songkicker media player plugin software.
Copyright Infringement Policy and Notice Procedure – which explains how you can ask Songkick to take down copyright protected content from the Songkick Website and Service.
Separate terms and conditions apply to the use of the Songkick APIs, which can be accessed via the following link: http://www.songkick.com/developer/api-terms-of-use.

Songkick.com Limited is registered in the United Kingdom with company number 06265278 and with its registered office at 12-18 Hoxton Street, Third floor, London, N1 6NG. VAT Number: 917418907.

1. Terms of Use
Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using the Service offered by Songkick. By using the Songkick Service you agree that you have read this agreement and agree to all of the provisions contained below.

1.1 Acceptance of Terms
By using the Service in any manner (including but not limited to visiting or browsing the website and creating an account) you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use without modification. These Terms of Use apply to all users of the Service, including users who access the artist fan club portions of the services or otherwise use the services as a member of an artist’s fan club, and including users who are also contributors of content, information and other materials or services on the Website. These terms also apply to all uses of the Service, including without limitation: purchasing tickets, merchandise and/or other products or services, following artists and/or receiving artist updates and information, obtaining event information and/or event notifications, or contributing and/or accessing fan-contributed content.

Certain services or features of the Service, such as ticket sales and merchandise purchases may be subject to additional terms and conditions promulgated by Songkick from time to time; your use of such features is also subject to those additional terms and conditions.

1.2 Age Restrictions
In general, the Service is available only to individuals who are at least thirteen (13) years old. You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are (i) at least eighteen (18) years old or (ii) if you are between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18), you have parental permission to enter into an agreement to accept these Terms of Use and to use the Service.

Higher age restrictions may apply for specific services offered by Songkick (such as ticket sales) as notified to you by Songkick.

1.3 Modification of Terms of Use
Songkick reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the Terms of Use. It is your responsibility to check the Terms of Use periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Use will be subject to the new Terms of Use.

1.4 Privacy
The use of the Service, including the Website, is subject to Songkick’s current privacy statement, which is located on the Website at www.songkick.com/info/privacy (the “Privacy Policy”) and is incorporated into the Terms of Use. For inquiries in regard to the Privacy Policy, or to report a privacy-related problem, please contact privacy@songkick.com.

1.5 Songkick Account
In order to use certain aspects of the Service, you may be required to register for an account on the Website (a “Songkick Account”). In all cases, when creating a Songkick Account you must provide Songkick with accurate and complete registration information and you shall keep your registration information up to date. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of the Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your Songkick Account.

There are two ways you may be able to create a Songkick Account:

Songkick Website account registration form
Where you create an account directly on the Songkick Website, you will be asked to select a password and screen name (“Songkick Username”). You shall not (i) select or use as a Songkick Username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a Songkick Username a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use as a Songkick Username a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. Songkick reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, a Songkick Username in its sole discretion.

You should use a different password for your Songkick Account to those that you use for your accounts with other online services.

Social media / ID service account
We may also allow you to create a Songkick Account by logging in to your account for a third party social network or ID service (such as Facebook, Google or Open ID). By using the Service through a third party social network or ID service, you permit us to access certain information from such account for use by the Service. You may control the amount of information that is accessible to us by adjusting your account privacy settings for such account.

You are solely responsible for activity that occurs on your Songkick and social media / ID service accounts and shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account passwords. You shall never use another user’s account without such other user’s express permission. You will immediately notify Songkick in writing of any unauthorized use of your account, or other account related security breach of which you are aware.

Please note that when you create or use your account to purchase fan-club-only presale tickets (“Fan Club Tickets”) (which will be clearly labeled as such), unless you are already a member, such registration and/or purchase constitutes an act of enrolling in such artist’s fan club on the Service, and therefore we may share your e-mail or other information, which may include personal information you provide to us in connection with such enrollment, with such artist so the artist can send you updates and information directly.

If you wish to terminate your Songkick Account, you may do so by following the instructions in the Account Settings section of the Website. When you terminate your Songkick Account, we will delete your account information within sixty (60) days, with the exception of your Username (which we retain in order to avoid re-use), your profile image, and any events, images, or videos that you have previously added to Songkick, all of which will continue to be publicly attributed to your Username. You may contact us to request that the retained data be deleted, which Songkick may do at its discretion.

1.6 Service Rules and Conduct
The Service is provided only for your own personal, non-commercial use. You shall not use the Service for any purpose that is prohibited by these Terms of Use, including:

Through the Service, you may be able to access various resources, products, services, content, information and features, including but not limited to, exclusive artist content, contests, artist merchandise, downloadable media, advertisements, advice, suggestions, videos, audio clips, messages, information, data, text, photographs, software, scripts, images, graphics and other content (“Content”). Some of this content may only be accessible on or through certain parts of the Service; for example, special fan club pre-sale information may not be available to you unless you are a part of an artist’s fan club on the Service. Songkick may, in its sole discretion, remove, modify, or otherwise change your ability to access any content on the Service at any time. Content specifically provided by Songkick or its partners may be protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights and laws.

You shall abide by all copyright notices, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Service. You shall not sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit, create derivative works from, or otherwise exploit any Content or third party submissions or other proprietary rights not owned by you: (i) without the consent of the respective owners or other valid right and (ii) in any way that violates any third party right.

You may, to the extent the Website expressly authorizes you to do so, download or copy Content (other than our Tourbox widget), and other items displayed on the Website for download, for personal use only, provided that you maintain all copyright and other notices contained in such Content.

You may, to the extent the Website expressly authorizes you to do so, download our Tourbox widget (which is provided free of charge) and use it for your own commercial use solely to the extent necessary for you to claim an artists’ page and upload tour dates for that artist. We do not guarantee that the Tourbox widget will distribute your tour dates to third parties. We do not accept any responsibility for the integrity of any data which you upload to the Website using the Tourbox widget. The Tourbox widget may have minimum system requirements for it to operate correctly. It is your responsibility to ensure that your system meets any such minimum requirements. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept any responsibility for your use of the Tourbox widget or its impact on your or any other website or online platform.

You shall not store any significant portion of the Songkick Website in any form. Copying or storing of any Content for other than for personal, non-commercial use is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from Songkick or from the copyright holder identified in such Content’s copyright notice.

Please be aware that the Website or other features of the Service may contain, or direct you to websites containing, information that some people may find offensive or inappropriate.

If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

1.17 Assignment

Songkick may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent, unless such action is prohibited by applicable law. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.

2. Terms of Sale
These Terms of Sale apply to tickets and merchandise purchased through the Songkick Website. Furthermore, some ticket or merchandise sales, such as Fan Club Presales or Fan Club Merchandise (defined below), have additional terms. Both these terms and any special terms form part of, are in addition to and incorporate the Songkick Terms. In these Terms of Sale, “we” or “us” refers to Songkick.com Limited (for sales of tickets to events in the UK) or Songkick.com, Inc. (for sales of tickets to events in the U.S. or Canada).

2.2 Acceptance of Your Purchase
All orders are subject to acceptance by us. When we accept your order, we do so on behalf of the event promoter, artist, venue or ticket seller who is providing those tickets (collectively, the “Ticket Providers”). As such, your contract for the purchase of those tickets is with the applicable Ticket Provider and although we agree to provide our ticket selling services to you via the Songkick Website, we are acting solely in the capacity of an agent for the applicable Ticket Provider. Once your order has been accepted by us on the Ticket Provider’s behalf our payment processor will charge your debit/credit card with the face value of the ticket, plus a booking fee (which is inclusive of VAT or other taxes, where applicable) (Note, we charge VAT or other taxes, where applicable, on the booking fee and not on the face value of the ticket). Acceptance of your order on the Ticket Provider’s behalf shall be deemed to have occurred, and a contract formed for the purchase of your tickets, when your payment has been cleared and a notice of confirmation has appeared on the purchase page of the Website. If you do not receive a confirmation after attempting to purchase tickets on the Website, or if you experience an error message or service interruption while attempting to purchase tickets, please check with us to confirm that your order has been placed. Songkick will not be responsible for any losses (monetary or otherwise) that are incurred due to a mistaken assumption regarding whether an order has been placed or accepted.

2.3 Errors
In the event that we make an error in pricing tickets on our website, we reserve the right to cancel your purchase and offer you the opportunity to purchase the tickets again at the correct price. If you choose to purchase the tickets at the correct price our payment provider will charge your debit/credit card with the difference between the incorrect value and the price you paid when originally booking. If you choose not to purchase the tickets at the correct price, we will refund you the full price you paid when originally booking.

2.4 Tickets
As stated above, ticket delivery options and details may vary based on your location and/or the location of the event. Tickets may be delivered to you as paper tickets or as electronic tickets depending on the format in which they are provided to us by the event organizer/promoter and depending on how you have selected to receive them when placing your order. Please note that we reserve the right to make tickets available to you in any format (for example by text message), but we will inform you of this before you make your purchase.

If you have elected to receive your ticket electronically your confirmation is your electronic ticket and you should bring this to the event as it may be checked (e.g. by barcode or other relevant details).

The ticket is your responsibility from the time of delivery, which shall be receipt of the electronic confirmation in the case of electronic tickets or on delivery to your designated address in the case of paper tickets. Songkick accepts no responsibility if you delete your confirmation e-mail or other correspondence or if your printed e-mail confirmation, other correspondence or paper ticket is lost or stolen prior to the event after they have been delivered to you. If a replacement ticket is offered (or the event has to confirm your purchase with us due to a lost or stolen ticket), we reserve the right to charge a reasonable replacement fee to cover administration costs.

Paper tickets will either be delivered to your designated address no later than 5 days prior to the event or will be made available for collection from the box office at the event venue. You may be able to specify which option you would prefer when placing your order, but we reserve the right to require you to collect your tickets from the box office if there isn’t enough time prior to the event to send them to your designated address. If you elect to receive paper tickets you may have to pay a delivery charge which will be indicated to you on the booking page of the website prior to you placing your order. If you need to change your designated address after you have placed your order please contact us as soon as possible. We cannot be held responsible if tickets have already been dispatched to the designated address already provided.

It is your responsibility to check that your tickets have been delivered to you, and check for any errors or omissions. Please report any issues to us as soon as possible. A failure to report a problem with your tickets reasonably promptly and in any case in good time prior to the event may result in you not being able to claim a refund even if the error or omission was initially our fault.

Your ticket is a personal revocable license which remains the property of the event organizer/promoter. It may be withdrawn and admission refused at any time upon refunding the purchase price to the holder of the account used to pay for the ticket (including where Songkick reasonably considers the ticket purchase or sale to be fraudulent or otherwise in violation of these Terms). If you attempt to unlawfully resell/purchase, or resell/purchase a ticket, or do so from or to an unauthorized source, it may be withdrawn and admission refused without refund or other compensation. Please be aware that tickets obtained from unauthorized sources may be lost, stolen or counterfeit, and if so, are void.

2.5 Artist Fan Club Tickets and Merchandise
One of the goals of Songkick’s Service is to give artists better tools to directly promote to and connect with their fan base, and potentially gain new fans in the process. Thus, from time to time, Songkick may offer exclusive access to tickets and/or merchandise (“Fan Club Merchandise”) on behalf of an artist, solely for sale to members of the artist’s fan club. Fan Club Presales and Fan Club Merchandise, as well as other artist Content on the Service, are offered to benefit both artists and their fans. However, please note that unlike some of the other Content or merchandise on the Service, special Fan Club Presales are only available for purchase by registered users who are members of that artist’s fan club. By using the Service to gain access to Fan Club Tickets or Fan Club Merchandise, you warrant that you are purchasing such tickets or merchandise for your personal use and as a member of the artist’s fan club. Fan Club Tickets and Fan Club Merchandise will be clearly labeled as such. All relevant event listings, ticket information (e.g. price, availability, type, dates, available purchase quantities, etc.), and other merchandise details are presented on the artist’s behalf.

2.6 Event Cancellation/Reschedule and Refunds
Once we have accepted your ticket purchase you will not have a right to cancel your ticket purchase or obtain a refund except in accordance with this section 2.6.

Songkick is typically only able to offer refunds and/or exchanges when the Ticket Provider authorizes refunds and/or exchanges, and such refunds and/or exchanges will be based on the Ticket Provider’s instructions. Songkick is not obligated to issue a refund except to the extent that the applicable Ticket Provider (i) instructs us to issue a refund to you, and (ii) provides us with the funds necessary to issue a refund to you. In qualifying situations, and where an event is cancelled or rescheduled, or if (as determined by Songkick acting reasonably) the details of the event have changed to a significantly material extent, the holder of the account used to pay for the ticket shall be entitled to a refund of the face value of the ticket plus the booking fee (or a partial refund in the event that only part of the event (other than the opening act or guest) is cancelled) but not for any delivery charge if paper tickets have already been dispatched. If you wish to exercise this right, you can notify us by e-mail (or reply to your confirmation e-mail) with the word ‘refund’ and your confirmation code in the subject heading or via such other process that we may reasonably require. Additionally, an applicable Ticket Provider may have additional instructions or deadlines that you may have to comply with in order to receive a refund or exchange, which, along with the decision about whether or not to issue a refund or an exchange, may be at the Ticket Provider’s discretion. Unless otherwise stated by us, refunds must be requested within two (2) weeks of the event change being announced. Unless indicated otherwise, if an event is rescheduled the holder of the account used to pay for the ticket will be offered a place at the rescheduled event. If they cannot make the rescheduled date a refund will be provided as above.

The holder of the account used to pay for the ticket shall also be entitled to a refund of the face value of the ticket plus the booking fee and any delivery charges if you do not receive the correct tickets due to a fault or breach of contract by us and we are not able to provide any replacement tickets to enable you to attend the event.

If there are any restrictions on refunds and/or exchanges for tickets you have purchased, you agree that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent any such restrictions in any manner. For example, you shall not dispute or otherwise seek a "chargeback" from your credit card company in an attempt to receive a “refund” where one would be otherwise prohibited. Should you do so, your tickets may be canceled, and we may, in our sole discretion, refuse to honor pending and future ticket purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts connected to your Account, and we may prohibit all persons related to your credit card or Account on the Service, or who otherwise breach this provision, from accessing or using the Website or Service in the future.

In addition to the provisions above, the following special provisions regarding refunds may apply to you:

For tickets to Illinois events: If you purchase tickets through Songkick to an event located in Illinois, you will receive a refund of the amount you paid for that ticket if: (i) the ticketed event is canceled (in which case you will not receive a refund of any delivery fees), (ii) that ticket does not allow you to enter the ticketed event for reasons that may include, without limitation, that the ticket is counterfeit or that the ticket has been canceled by the issuer due to non-payment, unless the ticket is canceled due to an act or omission by you, (iii) that ticket fails to conform to its description on the Website, or (iv) you failed to receive that ticket.

For tickets to New York events: If you purchase a ticket through Songkick to an event located in the State of New York, Songkick will provide to you a full refund of that amount you paid for that ticket if: (i) the ticketed event is canceled, provided that if the ticketed event is canceled then the order processing and delivery fees will not be refunded; (ii) the ticket does not grant you admission to the ticketed event, unless the ticket is canceled due to an act or omission by you; or (iii) the ticket fails to conform to its description on the Website, unless you have pre-approved a substitution of tickets.

It is the ticket holder’s responsibility to ascertain whether an event has been cancelled or rescheduled. If we are aware that an event is cancelled or rescheduled, we will attempt to notify ticket holders but we do not guarantee that ticket holders will be informed of cancellation in good time before the event.

2.7 Venue Rules and Regulations
Tickets to events purchased through Songkick are issued subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Ticket Provider(s).

2.8 Competitions, Promotions, Unauthorized Resale and Other Commercial Use of Tickets

Additionally, certain facilities may prohibit the possession of certain items on their premises, including without limitation, alcohol, drugs, controlled substances, cameras, and recording devices.

2.11 Our Liability

Liability for expenses incurred in connection with your planned attendance at an event (such as accommodation or transport costs) and any loss of enjoyment is expressly excluded. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that you assume all risks incidental to the event for which a ticket is issued, whether before, during or after performance, and you waive any claims for personal injury or death against Songkick, its management, officers, directors, owners, employees or agents on behalf of yourself and any accompanying minor. Songkick and the applicable Ticket Provider accepts no responsibility for loss or damage of personal property during your attendance at an event.

Nothing in these terms and conditions affects your statutory rights.

2.12 Applicable Law and Jurisdiction
